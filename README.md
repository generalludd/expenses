expenses
========

A simple expense accounting system for a cooperative housing situation

The database contains a simple interface for adding monthly expenses, multiple active users (and inactive users for historical data). Password-protected login and the ability to email password reset requests. 

Built on the Code Igniter framework, this system could be used for any kind of simple shared cost management system that allows people to see how much they owe, enter any reimbursements (with category, date and description) they may need, and enter the amount of monthly payment they've made. 

A schema database file is included in the root of the project named expenses.sql that contains some basic global settings, but otherwise requires some MySQL, php, and Code Igniter familiarty to install.
